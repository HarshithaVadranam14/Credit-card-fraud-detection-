This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The dataset used contains transaction data, where each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. By training a Random Forest model on this data, the project classifies new transactions, helping to identify potentially fraudulent activities. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to ensure its effectiveness in detecting fraud.
